    <h2>About project</h2>

    <p>
      We are a dotcom gallery working in the field of Art Jewelry and
      Contemporary Crafts. The company was launched in 2016 and is membership
      based. Our objective is to communicate the current activity and insights
      of Contemporary Jewelry worldwide. We select, organize, edit, generate and
      publish information that keeps recorded in our database and accessible for
      members & non-members from any device with an internet connection. We give
      value to creation in this field. We have shaped and communicated the
      scenario to this value and now we are building a market for it. Our target
      is international art lovers. Our selection criteria, reporting about the
      current creation of a network of the professionals is our reference
      criteria. Consolidate the platform Inache Gallery in order to promote for
      the international community what happens in Contemporary Jewelry & Crafts,
      providing the resources to create a market for companies to find
      designers, collectors to purchase works, museums to enlarge the
      collections, students, teachers, experts, and artists to access relevant
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>Our service</h2>

    <p>
      By becoming familiar with Inache Gallery you will gain knowledge and
      further ability to assess and recognize creativity. Inache Gallery
      specifically presents the creations that exist within the world of art
      jewelry and contemporary crafts . This is our main service and at the same
      time our reason for being involved in the development of this area. Our
      project is like a circle that converts knowledge into emotion. Promoting
      the acquisition of this kind of work is our way of following that circle.
      This generates a feedback state where the artist and his or her creation,
      knowledge and emotions have the possibility of being expressed and used.
      Therefore creativity and art are profitable, in both a spiritual and
      economical manner. Trough this careful and considerate selection, Inache
      Gallery attempts to explain this interdisciplinary synthesis.
    </p>

    <h2>Criteria</h2>

    <p>
      Our initial intention with Inache Gallery was to create a space where we
      could show the work of contemporary artists, what it generates and
      anything associated with this subject. Having the knowledge to inform and
      be informed to know. We wanted to set up a place where information could
      be attained, seen, contributed, consulted or swapped, so this became the
      starting point for this project. By working with global art jewelry and
      contemporary crafts experts, Inache Gallery is able to offer a selection
      based on specific artistic principles: clear conceptual criteria, high
      standard technic skills, and wearability. We understand that jewelry &
      crafts are artistic disciplines, where the works of art contain concepts
      and messages, and that the value of the materials used is considered
      secondary. Jewelry and Crafts are artistic disciplines equal to any other
      yet at the same time reflect other art forms. Inache Gallery treats them
      as art and representation, giving special emphasis to the idea that
      creativity is truly and undoubtedly transversal.
    </p>

    <p>
      An international network of specialized co-operators, who will form a
      working team around Inache Gallery, is being created. By way of our forum,
      where information is dispersed and collected, we have set up a
      communication reference area to debate jewelry and crafts and establish
      knowledge networks. In order to achieve easy accessibility, we have chosen
      an online format. Through this platform, it is easy to send and share
      information, giving you not only a fast, current and up to date
      communication tool, but also the possibility to handle, store, dispose of
      or offer to others a range of information of the best quality.

    <p>
      Friends, today the project has a birthday. Otherwise, we are three years
      old. We accept congratulations. In connection with this joyful event, we
      have amazing news for you. We thought for a long time and finally decided
      - there will be a second exhibition! We took into account previous
      experience and therefore this time everything will be somewhat more
      complicated, but we hope to get a much cooler result. The theme of the
      exhibition is “The Contrast of Two”, it will be devoted to the harmony and
      aesthetics of the different and even the opposite. This time applications
      will be accepted on a competitive basis! Participation is paid.
